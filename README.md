# Protect API Management with OAuth

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This azd template is still under development.

---


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites  

Before you can deploy this template, make sure you have the following tools installed and the necessary permissions:  

- [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)  
  - Installing `azd` also installs the following tools:  
    - [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com)  
    - [Bicep CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install)  
- [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) 
  _(This template has several hooks. See [this section](#hooks) for more information.)_
- You need **Owner** or **Contributor** permissions on an Azure Subscription to deploy this template.  
- You need **Application Administrator** or **Cloud Application Administrator** permissions to register the Entra ID app registrations. 
  _(You already have enough permissions if 'Users can register applications' is enabled in your Entra tenant.)_

### Deployment

Once the prerequisites are installed on your machine, you can deploy this template using the following steps:

1. Run the `azd init` command in an empty directory with the `--template` parameter to clone this template into the current directory.  

    ```cmd
    azd init --template ronaldbosma/protect-apim-with-oauth
    ```

    When prompted, specify the name of the environment, for example, `oauth`. The maximum length is 32 characters.

1. Run the `azd auth login` command to authenticate to your Azure subscription _(if you haven't already)_.

    ```cmd
    azd auth login
    ```

1. Run the `azd up` command to provision the resources in your Azure subscription and Entra ID tenant. This deployment will typically take around 4 minutes to complete.

    ```cmd
    azd up
    ```

    See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) if you encounter any issues during deployment.

1. Once the deployment is complete, you can locally modify the application or infrastructure and run `azd up` again to update the resources in Azure.

### Clean up

Once you're done and want to clean up, run the `azd down` command. By including the `--purge` parameter, you ensure that the API Management service doesn't remain in a soft-deleted state, which could block future deployments of the same environment.

```cmd
azd down --purge
```

## Hooks

This template has several hooks that are executed at different stages of the deployment process. The following hooks are included:

- [predown-remove-app-registrations.ps1](hooks/predown-remove-app-registrations.ps1): 
  This PowerShell script is executed before the resources are removed. 
  It removes the app registrations created during the deployment process, because `azd` doesn't support deleting Entra ID resources yet. 
  See the related GitHub issue: https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/issues/4724.
  
- [predown-remove-law.ps1](hooks/predown-remove-law.ps1): 
  This PowerShell script is executed before the resources are removed. 
  It permanently deletes the Log Analytics workspace to prevent issues with future deployments. 
  Sometimes the requests and traces don't show up in Application Insights & Log Analytics when removing and deploying the template multiple times.


## Troubleshooting

### API Management deployment failed because the service already exists in soft-deleted state

If you've previously deployed this template and deleted the resources, you may encounter the following error when redeploying the template. This error occurs because the API Management service is in a soft-deleted state and needs to be purged before you can create a new service with the same name.

```json
{
    "code": "DeploymentFailed",
    "target": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/rg-oauth-sdc-wiyuo/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deployments/apiManagement",
    "message": "At least one resource deployment operation failed. Please list deployment operations for details. Please see https://aka.ms/arm-deployment-operations for usage details.",
    "details": [
        {
            "code": "ServiceAlreadyExistsInSoftDeletedState",
            "message": "Api service apim-oauth-sdc-wiyuo was soft-deleted. In order to create the new service with the same name, you have to either undelete the service or purge it. See https://aka.ms/apimsoftdelete."
        }
    ]
}
```

Use the [az apim deletedservice list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/apim/deletedservice?view=azure-cli-latest#az-apim-deletedservice-list) Azure CLI command to list all deleted API Management services in your subscription. Locate the service that is in a soft-deleted state and purge it using the [purge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/apim/deletedservice?view=azure-cli-latest#az-apim-deletedservice-purge) command. See the following example:

```cmd
az apim deletedservice purge --location "swedencentral" --service-name "apim-oauth-sdc-wiyuo"
```
