  This PowerShell script is executed before the resources are removed. 
  It removes the app registrations created during the deployment process, because `azd` doesn't support deleting Entra ID resources yet. 
  See the related GitHub issue: https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/issues/4724.
  We're using a predown hook because the environment variables are (sometimes) empty in a postdown hook.
