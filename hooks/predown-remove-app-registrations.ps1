  The Azure Developer CLI doesn't support deleting Entra ID resources yet, so we have to do it in a hook.
  Related GitHub issue: https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/issues/4724
  
  We're using a predown hook because the environment variables are (sometimes) empty in a postdown hook.
  The Entra ID resources have a custom tag "azd-env-id: <environment-id>", so we can find and delete them.
